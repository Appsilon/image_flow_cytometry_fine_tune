# scifAI-notebooks

Here, we present scifAI-notebooks which are used to analyze the synapse formation data including feature extraction, statistical analysis and machine learning methods. Each folder includes a jupyter notebook that is used for creation of the figures for the manuscript.

Note: this repository only includes the jupyter notebooks on the synapse formation data (to be published). For following on how this scifAI package is works, please refer to https://github.com/marrlab/scifAI
